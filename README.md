# Yellowstone-Memory-Game-With-IMages
A memory game with Images Bernard A. Bailey, Jr. took in 2006
This is a memory game in progress. It drags and drops. I need to have when they match only then will they be droppable. And if they 
do not match they will flip back over. My isMatch function is not working in my JAVAscript file. I believe I have an issue with an 
event handler. Any help is appreciated. The photos are my own images I created the back using paint3D and rexize my original images using 
Microsoft Paint!!
